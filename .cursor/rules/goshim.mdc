# GoShim Rules

Refer to [cmd/goshim/README.md](file:cmd/goshim/README.md) for complete documentation.

## Usage in Development

- Always use `./goshim` instead of `go` for workspace operations
- Use `./goshim mod tidy` for workspace-aware dependency management  
- Enable `-pipe-stdio` flag when debugging Go command behavior
- Use `-verbose` flag when troubleshooting wrapper issues

## Code Patterns

- Process replacement with `syscall.Exec` for transparent operation
- Safe go binary resolution to prevent recursion loops
- Workspace root detection via `go.work` and `go.mod` traversal
- stdio wrapping with `io.MultiWriter` for logging without interference
- Context-based operations for cancellation and timeout support

## Integration Points

- Drop-in replacement for `go` command in scripts and tools
- Designed for symlink scenarios (common in development environments)
- Compatible with VS Code Go extension and task runners
- Workspace-aware operations that respect `go.work` boundaries
