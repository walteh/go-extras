**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Agents should update this rule when testing practices change**

# Testing Standards

## Test Case Naming
- Use descriptive test names with `Test` prefix (e.g., `TestVMBootTime`)
- For subtests, use descriptive names with underscores (e.g., `test_with_init_injection`)
- Avoid spaces and special characters in test names

## Testing Tools and Commands
- **Always use `./goshim test`** (not `go test` directly)
- Be aware that some tests or features may require specific **build tags** (e.g., `-tags libkrun_efi`). Consult module-specific documentation or `main.go` examples for required tags. Run tests with appropriate tags to ensure full coverage of features.
  Example: `./goshim test -tags=customfeature ./pkg/custommodule/`
- `./goshim test -function-coverage` - Verify >85% function coverage (required)
- `./goshim test -v` - Verbose output for debugging
- `./goshim test -run TestName` - Run specific test
- `./goshim test -bench=.` - Run benchmarks
- `./goshim test -codesign` - Test with code signing (macOS virtualization)
- `./goshim test -ide` - IDE-compatible output format

## Assertions & Mocking
- Use `testify/assert` for assertions
- Use `testify/require` for critical checks that should stop test execution
- Use `testify/mock` for creating mocks (or mockery generated mocks)
- Always add descriptive messages to assertions:
  ```go
  require.NoError(t, err, "VM boot should succeed")
  assert.Equal(t, expected, actual, "boot time should be under 100ms")
  ```

## Performance Testing
- Critical paths MUST have benchmarks
- Use stream performance testing framework for I/O operations:
  ```go
  reader := tstream.NewTimingReader(r)
  // Automatic bottleneck detection
  ```
- Target metrics:
  - VM boot: <100ms
  - API response: <5ms
  - Command execution: <10ms overhead

## Code Testability
- Write code that is deliberately easy to test
- Keep unit tests simple, clear, and exhaustive
- Prefer table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Use interfaces for dependencies to enable mocking

## Testing Workflow
- Run tests before committing: `./goshim test -function-coverage ./...`
- Fix any coverage drops immediately
- Performance regressions are blocking issues

## Mock Generation
- Define interfaces in appropriate packages
- Add to `.mockery.yaml` for automatic generation
- Generate mocks: `./goshim run github.com/vektra/mockery/v2`
- Mocks are created in `./gen/mockery/`

## Coverage Requirements
- **>85% function coverage** is mandatory (enforced by CI)
- Use `./goshim test -function-coverage` to check
- Coverage reports show which functions need tests

## Best Practices
- Test both success and error paths
- Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests
- Clean up resources with `t.Cleanup()` or defer
- Use subtests with `t.Run()` for related test cases
- Never rename test packages from `x_test` to `x` unless absolutely necessary

## Debugging Tests
- Use `./goshim test -v` for verbose output
- For debugging specific tests: `./goshim dap` with VS Code
- Profile tests: `./goshim test -cpuprofile=cpu.prof`
- Use `slog` for debug logging in tests (respects test verbosity)
