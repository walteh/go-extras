# CodeSign Rules

Refer to [cmd/codesign/README.md](mdc:root/file:cmd/codesign/README.md) for complete documentation.

## Usage in Development

- Use `go tool github.com/walteh/go-extras/cmd/codesign` via Go 1.24+ tool directive
- Prefer friendly entitlement names (`virtualization`, `hypervisor`) over Apple identifiers
- Use `-mode=test` for Go test integration with automatic signing
- Always use `-dry-run` first to verify operations before execution

## Code Patterns

- Structured logging with `slog` and `tint` for consistent output
- Context-based operations with `slogctx` for request tracing
- Mode-based command design (`sign`, `exec`, `test`, `detect`)
- Entitlements XML generation from friendly names or full identifiers
- Legacy mode compatibility for backward compatibility with existing tools

## Apple Integration

- Ad-hoc signing with `-` identity for development
- Entitlements XML file generation for complex scenarios
- `codesign` command wrapper with force re-signing support
- Detection mode for analyzing existing binary signatures
